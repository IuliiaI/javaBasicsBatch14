		 * when we sre converting something smaller to larger we dont need to do anything
		 * it happens automatically we just assign the variable for example
		 * 
		 * int box=1234;
		 * 
		 * long box2=box; //this is how it works and it is called implicit or widening automatically

		 * however when we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type ten this is how we do it
		 * 
		 * long box=1245454;
		 * 
		 * int box2=(int)box; narrowing or explicit or manual conversion
